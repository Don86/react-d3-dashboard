# react-d3-dashboard
Playing around with react + d3.

A simple dashboard that currently tracks a portfolio, which only comprises:
 - A term deposit
 - A single index fund.

More functions and choices coming after I get these two running.

This is not a trading viz platform, more a portfolio projection dashboard for long-term, buy-and-hold passive investors. 

## Stack

* Stock price API from Alpha Vantage
* Framework = ReactJS
* Viz with D3 (because `react-charts-2` and `victory` aren't customizable enough, or have insufficient documentation)
